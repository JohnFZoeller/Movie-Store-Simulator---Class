# Movie-Store-Simulator---Class
Simulates a Movie Store.

Compiled using the Unix terminal via the following command.   

g++ *.cpp -Wall -Werror; ./a.out > finalOutput.txt;




This was the final project for my final Data Structures and algorithms class.

Take a txt file as input representing a list of movies.
  Convert that file into movie objects and store these objects in Binary Search Trees for efficient retrieval.
  
Take a txt file containing customer information. 
  Create hash table entries for each customer.
  
Take a txt file representing commands to be executed by the program (borrow movie, return movie, etc...)
  Process these commands.
  


All Files are included.
